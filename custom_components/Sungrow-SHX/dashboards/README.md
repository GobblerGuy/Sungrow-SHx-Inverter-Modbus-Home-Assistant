# Collection of dashboards

contributions are very welcome!

Please send me your dashboard via Pullrequest

1. Create a subfolder {HACS_}%DESRCIPTION%_%YOUR_NAME%
- {HACS_} should be pre-pended, if the dashboard is using HACS addons
- %DESCRIPTION%: Short (1-3 words) description of the dashboard
- %YOUR_NAME%: required to get your the well-deserved fame 

- Examples:
  - "_DefaultDashboard_mkaiser"   (not using HACS here, because it shall be easy to use). I underlined it, so it will be always on top (as it is the default)
  - "HACS_PowerFlow_mkaiser"     (uses the HACS addon for powerflow)


2. Add (multiple) screenshots
3. Add README.md with install instructions
